## Calculator Implementation in Zig

This is yet another one of my personal silly projects where I am simply learning Zig.

This calculator asks for user input, parses it as long as it is a mathematical expression (a simple one, following PEMDAS) and outputs the result.

Feel free to $#!T on my code!
